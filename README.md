# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on different features such as area, number of bedrooms, and location using Machine Learning.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Objective
To build a simple regression model that can predict house prices and help beginners understand machine learning concepts.

## Status
Project under development.
## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries using:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Run the Python file:
   python house_price_prediction.py

## Sample Output

Mean Squared Error: <value>
Predicted Price: <predicted house price>

## Future Improvements

- Use a larger real-world dataset
- Add more features like location and year built
- Apply advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
